The two types of available remote sensing data is LiDAR elevation data and aerial photography, the latter simply referred to as \textit{RGB} data from now on.
We will investigate to what degree these features are useful for predicting surface normal rasters.
Of special interest is how these two feature types compare to each other when it comes to the predictive accuracy.
Both feature types provide birds-view perspectives, and we hypothesize that models based on LiDAR will fare better than RGB models due to the importance of the spatial information when it comes to surface normals.
A model using \textit{both} features types combined will also be constructed and trained, and we will compare the accuracy of this model to the two models using the respective feature types in isolation.
