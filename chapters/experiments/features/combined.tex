We now construct a model which uses both LiDAR and RGB data in combination in order to produce predictions.
The training procedure of the combined data model is shown in \cref{fig:combined-training}, and the training procedures of the two single-input models have been included for comparison.

\Cref{fig:combined-training} does not show any immediately obvious in predictive performance between the LiDAR-only model and the combined input model.
The distribution of the instance-averaged cosine similarities over the test set have been plotted in \cref{fig:combined-test-distribution}.

Compared to the LiDAR-only model, the combined input model has decreased the mean instance-averaged cosine similarity from \num{0.00294} to \num{0.00265}, and negligible increased the median from \num{0.00043} to \num{0.00044}.
With other words, the combined input model has not increased the predictive performance as much as the LiDAR-only model improved upon the RGB-only model, but it still has somewhat better test performance.

The median test prediction of the combined input model is provided in \cref{fig:combined-median-prediction}.
