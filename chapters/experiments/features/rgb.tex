A model using only RGB data is trained, and the training procedure is summarized in \cref{fig:rgb-training} side-by-side the LiDAR-only model for comparison purposes.

\noindent
From \cref{fig:rgb-training} it is immediately obvious that a RGB-only model performs worse than a LiDAR-only model, as hypothesized.
In order to confirm this, the instance-averaged cosine similarity distribution over the test set is yet again plotted in \cref{fig:rgb-test-distribution}, this time for the RGB-only model instead.

  \label{fig:rgb-test-distribution}
\end{figure}
%
As can be seen in \cref{fig:rgb-test-distribution} the mean instance-averaged cosine similarity evaluated over the test set increases from \num{0.00294} to \num{0.00402}, and the median increases from \num{0.00043} to \num{0.00078}.
The RGB-only surface normal vector model can therefore be concluded to be strictly worse than the LiDAR-only equivalent model.

Yet again we plot the median test prediction of the RGB-only model in \cref{fig:rgb-median-prediction} as a representative prediction.
