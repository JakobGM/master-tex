This section will investigate the inference of flat roof surfaces using the raster data produced by the pipeline outlined in \cref{sec:data}.
The U-Net model architecture presented in \cref{sec:unet} is used for semantic segmentation, while the slightly modified U-Net architecture presented in \cref{sec:normal-model} will be used for predicting surface normal vectors.
We start by describing the general experimental setup in \cref{sec:experimental-setup}.
\Cref{sec:specialization-project-summary} provides a summary of all the relevant experimental results of my specialization project~\cite{specialization-project} related to semantic segmentation of roof structures.
A comparative investigation into the suitability of the different raster data types (aerial photography and/or LiDAR DSMs) for surface normal prediction is presented in \cref{sec:features}.
Lastly, a multitask learning model for predicting semantic segmentation masks \emph{and} surface normal vectors simultaneously is tested in \cref{sec:multitask-experiments}.
