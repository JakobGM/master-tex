We will use the \enquote{Ortofoto Trondheim 2017}\footnote{Product specification for \enquote{Ortofoto Trondheim 2017} can be found here:\\ \url{https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/cd105955-6507-416f-86d2-6d95c1b74278}.} aerial photography dataset from 2017 which requires \SI{161}{\giga\byte} of storage space.
The real image resolution is \SIrange{0.04}{0.15}{\meter}, but is provided with an resampled resolution of \SI{0.1}{\meter} for consistency, that is, each pixel is of size $\SI{0.1}{\meter} \times \SI{0.1}{\meter}$.
The reported accuracy is \SI{\pm 0.35}{\meter}~\cite{trondheim_ortophoto_2017}, although the exact type of this accuracy is not specified.
An exemplified region is visualized in \cref{fig:rgb-example}.

An \textit{orthophoto} is an image where the geographic scale is uniform over the entire image.
Proper orthophotos are expensive to manufacture and are therefore seldomly available for most geographic regions~\cite{ortofoto_in_norway_2003}, including Trondheim.
Aerial photography which has not been properly \enquote{ortho-rectified} may impede location-based inference as there exists no exact one-to-one mapping between image pixels and geographic coordinates.
This problem is best understood by an example, as shown in \cref{fig:non-orthophoto-example}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0) {\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{data/non-orthophoto-example}};
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
      \draw[orange, ultra thick, fill=orange!50, fill opacity=0.25]

        (0.615, 0.55) --

        (0.33, 0.445) --
        cycle;
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

As can be seen in \cref{fig:non-orthophoto-example}, the \enquote{Ortofoto Trondheim 2017} dataset clearly shows one side of a building due to the perspective of the plane capturing the image.
An ideal orthophoto would capture all vertical building walls as single, straight lines, no matter the perspective.
The effect of this \enquote{parallax error} on semantic segmentation predictions has been investigated in our previous work~\cite{specialization-project}, the conclusion being that it does \emph{not} impede predictive accuracy to a major degree.

The LiDAR dataset used is \enquote{Høydedata Trondheim 5pkt 2017}\footnote{Product specification for \enquote{Høydedata Trondheim 5pkt 2017} can be found here:\\ \url{https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/bec4616f-9a62-4ecc-95b0-c0a4c29401dc}.} from \date{2017-10-10} and requires \SI{25}{\giga\byte} of storage space.
The pixel size is $\SI{0.25}{\meter} \times \SI{0.25}{\meter}$ and the LiDAR measurements have a reported standard deviation of \SI{0.02}{\meter}~\cite{trondheim_lidar_2017}.
LiDAR visualized as a grayscale image over the same region as in \cref{fig:rgb-example} is presented in \cref{fig:lidar-example}.
