We will start by providing an introduction to the world of \textit{Geographic Information Systems} (GIS); the field which concerns itself with representing geographic data, in \cref{sec:data}.
We will also describe how to pre-process such geographic data in order to produce rasters which are suitable for training accurate machine learning models.
An overview of the problem domain of image segmentation and the methods currently being applied in the field will be provided in \cref{sec:modeling}, a chapter which will also describe the specific model architectures which consume and produce the data formats described in the previous chapter.
The post-processing required in order to produce vectorized surface polygons from predicted rasters will be described in \cref{chap:post-processing}.
Finally, the training procedure and experimental results will be presented and discussed in \cref{sec:experiments}.
